[INEX](https://www.inex.ie/) are pleased to to be able to release **IXP Manager** under
an open source license (the GNU Public License V2) which we hope will
benefit the wider IXP community, and especially new and small IXPs
looking to expand. IXP Manager is a web application built entirely in 
house by the INEX operations team.

**IXP Manager** is primarily a web application with associated scripts and
utilities which will allow IXPs to manage new customers, provision new
connections and services and monitor traffic usage. It also has a self
contained customer portal allowing IXP members to view their IXP traffic
statistics and a unique tool called My Peering Manager enabling IXP
members to request, manage and track peerings with other members.

IXP Manager is written in PHP using the Zend Framework, the Doctrine2 ORM
and the Smarty templating engine. The project website and source code
can be viewed at https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.

INEX is an Internet eXchange Point and Ireland's IP peering hub. It is a 
neutral, industry-owned Association, founded in 1996, that provides IP 
peering facilities for its members. INEX membership is open to all 
organisations that can benefit from peering their IP traffic.

## Commercial Support

We will consider feature requests, especially where they benefit INEX also and would certainly love feature patches!

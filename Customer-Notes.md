**INTRODUCED:** 20130403 - V3.0.8 (sponsored by [LONAP](http://www.lonap.net/))

Customer Notes allow administrators to add / update / view / delete notes on a per customer basis via the customer overview page. Specific features include:

* all actions are via AJAX allowing a quick seamless experience;
* notes can be private (visable to admins only) or public (also visable to the customer via their own portal);
* if a note is marked as public, there is a clear and obvious user interface hint to remind the admin of this;
* there is a *Unread Notes* action via the *My Account* menu to show a given admin a list of customers with unread notes for that admin;
* notes have a title (required) and a plain text area for additional information.
* admins can choose to be alerted by email to new / edited / deleted notes in one of three ways:
  * all notes for all customers
  * watched customers only
  * watched notes only
